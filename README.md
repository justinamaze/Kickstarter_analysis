# Kickstarter_analysis

### Overview of the project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilize the Kickstarter dataset to provide the visual Theater outcomes based on Launch date and Outcomes Based on the Goal. 

### Analysis
I started with the visual for the Theater outcomes based on Launch date. I created a Pivot table that can show a detailed chart and graph of outcomes.The key to getting a successful chart is utilizing the Pivot chart appropriately to get the most accurate results. And after doing so I filter out the Month,s Successful, failed, cancelled, and Grand total. That helped me create a line graph that i titled with the results. With the Outcomes Based on Goal analysis I depended more on code to gather my results. I used the Countifs function to determine how many theater groups met, failed, or cancelled their based goal. With the count ifs function I gather information from certain cells from the kickstarter analysis and I grouped the cells with the countifs function to get my answer, if the goal was greater than, less than, and or equal to the based goal. 

### Challenges
I came across severall challenges throughout this project. The most memeorable would be using the countifs function. The fucnction requires a long list of formulas and with one mistake or error in that formula your entire answer will be wrong. I overcame this challenge by being patient and watching the Hint video so I can see how it's done visually. 

### Results
For the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date sheet i've concluded that the successful theater outcomes area took place in the spring and summer for the months of May to August. What I can also conclude is that May is month that had the most succefull theater outcomes and the most failed outcomes as well. 
For the Outcomes based on goals sheet i've concluded that the lowest goal has the highest success percentage and vice versa for the highest goal with the lowest success percentage. I've also concluded that most projects were done in between the 1000 to 4999 range. 

### Limitations
I'd say one limitation of this data sheet is in the Theater outcomes by launch date sheet. In the month of October there weren't any cancellations and it shows on the graph. But on the graph the lines stop which brings more attention to the graph. How does an indiviual who's looking at the graph and chart know that the number is supposed to be zero in that blank?

### Tables/Graphs
Another pivot table and chart that could be created is, the successful groups with the backers count. So people can see what groups received extra funding and who had the most on the back-end.
